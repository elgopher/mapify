**Highly configurable** struct to map converter. _Will convert maps into other maps as well (work in progress)._

## Features

* **configuration outside the struct**
  * could be in a different package - separation of concerns
  * no need to modify original structs (by adding tags, implementing methods etc.)
  * **behaviour as a code** - you provide code which will be run during conversion
* ability to **rename keys** during conversion
* ability to **omit keys** based on field name, value or tag etc.
* ability to **map elements** during conversion
